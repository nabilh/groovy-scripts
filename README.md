# groovy-scripts

This repo is for useful Groovy scripts that can be used as a shell script.
This kind of "restricted Groovy" script is intended as a replacement for a Bash
script.

In particular, this kind of script will not have classes, and will not use
any OO principles. They are designed to be "flat", and usable as a Bash script
is, i.e. runnable as a text file, without need for build and pacakge into a jar file.

All you need to use the script is to put it on your path, make it executable, and just run it like any other bash script.

In other words, if you download script ascript.groovy, copy it, say to ~/bin or ~/scripts, wherever you run shell scripts from. You can rename it at that time, and remove the ".groovy" extension. Then just chmod +x the script file.
